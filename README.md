# COMP221_Final_Project
Final programming project for COMP 221: Algorithm and Data Structures. This project including application of maze generation, maze solving and knapsack problem
# How to run the program
To run the program, run class MazeGenerator. A new window will appear with the initial state of the maze. Click on this window to generate a maze and read instruction
in the running shell. Please keep in mind that you need to enter the item you choose one by one, and hit Return every time. After finishing
entering the chosen items, enter "done" and hit Return. Then click on the maze screen to see the animation.
# How I know that I win?
The animation of the maze will finish a complete escapting path if your combination produced less or equal time with the allowed time.
The animation will stopped at the middle of the path if you run out of time.
Then the running shell will appear the result whether you actually won or lost. If you won, it will automatically transfer to the new level. Click
on the maze screen again to generate the new level question. If you lose, the program will stopped.
# Information
There is 5 different level of difficulties, and the range of items in each level is from 4 to 12 items. Time allowed is calculated so that you will
always have enough time to take something and escape sucessfully. Therefore, we do not allow you to take nothing!!! Be greedy!!!
